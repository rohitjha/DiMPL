  	The 'toBase' function converts a number from decimal base to a specified base in the form of digits.
  	The function takes two arguments, both of type Integer.

  	Below are a few examples:

  	>>> toBase 8 37
  	[4,5]
		
  	>>> toBase 100 233243
  	[23,32,43]
		
  	>>> toBase 9 233243
  	[3,8,4,8,4,8]
		
  	>>> toBase 35 233243
  	[5,15,14,3]
-}
toBase :: Integer -> Integer -> [Integer]

{-|
	The 'toDec' function converts a decimal number to its decimal equivalent.
	The function returns a list of digits of the decimal number.
  	The function takes one argument of type Integer, which is the decimal number.

  	Below are a few examples:

  	>>> toDec 15
	[1,5]

	>>> toDec 123
	[1,2,3]
-}
toDec :: Integer -> [Integer]

{-|
	The 'toHex' function converts a decimal number to its hexadecimal equivalent.
  	The function takes one argument of type Integer, which is the decimal number.

  	Below are a few examples:

  	>>> toHex 15
	[15]

	>>> toHex 1200
	[4,11,0]
-}
toHex :: Integer -> [Integer]
toHex = toBase 16


{-|
  	The 'fromBase' function converts a number from a specified base to decimal in the form of a list of digits.
  	The function takes two arguments, the first of type Integer and the second of type [Integer].

  	Below are a few examples:

  	>>> fromBase 16 [15,15,15]
  	4095
		
  	>>> fromBase 100 [21,12,1]
  	211201
		
  	>>> fromBase 2 [1,0,1]
  	5

{-|
  	The 'fromBin' function converts a number from binary (in the form of a list of digits) to decimal.
  	The function takes two arguments, the first of type Integer and the second of type [Integer].

  	Below are a few examples:

  	>>> fromBin [1,0,1,0]
